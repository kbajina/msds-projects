# Masters in Data Science (MSDS) Project Portflio
### Overview:
This repository highlights major projects completed during the course of my Masters in Data Science at Northwestern University.

## Portfolio Projects Summary:
### [1) Home Building Project Simulation:](https://github.com/kbajina/msds-projects/tree/main/home-building-project-simulation)
**Objective:**  
Identify the sequence of activities for a home building project that will likely lead to the minimal total completion time.  
*Note: the definition and constraints identified in the project folder (link above).*

**Motivation:**  
To develop a simulation that examines multiple scenarios for a home building project, accounts for project constraints (i.e., order of activities that can be completed, minimum workers needed per activity, etc.) and examines the ability to complete different activities concurrently based on the available resources (i.e., worker crew headcount). In addition, this project performs a sensitivity analysis on available crew members, to examine how the modification of workers-on-hand can impact the overall productivity of the home build, and suggest a more optimal sequence of activities.
